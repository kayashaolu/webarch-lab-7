# Lab 7
Using POST

## In this lab you will accomplish the following:
 - Learn how to use POST requests to send data to the server

## Convert a GET request into a POST request
 - Take the example given at the end of [last weeks lecture](https://kayashaolu.github.io/webarch/html/Lecture%2012%20-%20Server%20Programming%20II.html)
 - Convert the form that captured a day of the week from the form from GET to POST
 - Need to modify both the form and the server code
 - Functionality must stay the same
